# MediAlert

An android application (React webapp in progress) to allow users to enter medicine information. The app creates recurring alarms for the medications based on the dates and times entered.

## Future Developments
- React Webapp
- Using Machine Learning to predict what days/times users are likely to forget taking the medicine. The app will then create more urgent/noticeable reminders for these days/times.
